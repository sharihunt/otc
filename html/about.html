		<div class="quote floatRight">OTC is about giving guidance to groups and organizations who find themselves at the beginning of their journeys.</div><h3 class="aboutHeaders">There's&nbsp;Always&nbsp;A&nbsp;Beginning</h3>
		<p>Large organizations were once a group of people coming together to help those around them. Over time, in some fortunate cases a century or more, the group becomes an organization of groups continuing the mission to serve their communities. Before they could expand to the reach we see today they had to start their journey.</p>
		
		<h3 class="aboutHeaders">Why Should You Attend</h3>
		<p>The Out There Conference is about giving guidance to groups and organizations who find themselves at the beginning of their journeys. Everyday is about learning and growing. Necessity is often the greatest teacher. However, if it's possible to learn from others' experiences or to work through a plan with others that will allow an organization to avoid even one obstacle we understand the impact that has on the organization and those they serve.</p>
		
		<h3 class="aboutHeaders">Who Should Attend</h3>
		<p>OTC is attended by nonprofit organization leaders (founders, board members, committee members and/or staff) who are&#58;</p>
		<ul class="aboutList">
		<li>Working with a recently created organization</li>
		<li>Going through a restructuring and starting from scratch</li>
		<li>Deciding if they will go through the process of becoming a nonprofit</li>
		</ul><br />
		
		<h3 class="aboutHeaders">Welcome to Houston</h3>
		<img src="../images/downtownHouston.jpg" width="214" height="136" alt="Photo of Houston skyline." class="floatLeft" /><p>A&nbsp;population over 2 million people insures that most national organizations have a chapter in Houston. Almost 7,800 tax-exempt organizations in the city means Houstonians not only participate in national nonprofits, they create their own.</p>
		<p>In addition to addressing the typical needs (i.e. arts, shelter, food banks, etc.) local organizations assist in areas that may be overlooked by others. From making sure children ineligible for free/reduced meals still have hot lunches to cleaning our bayous.</p>
		<p>Having organizations that support the community is not enough if there's no way for volunteers and donors to learn about them. Houston is known for providing such resources.</p>
		<p>We are proud to host OTC in such a rich nonprofit environment.</p>
